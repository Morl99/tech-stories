In 2016, Deutsche Bahn decided to get rid of their own data centers
and to migrate the majority of applications to the cloud.
The cloudification of Deutsche Bahn was supported by a comprehensive transformation of its digital partner DB Systel
from traditional working and organisational structures to self-organisation and company-wide networks,
including a DevOps culture. Within this context, the first Kubernetes platform services emerge.
From an OpenShift-based Kubernetes-Namespace-as-a-Service into a GitOps based K8s fleet management,
we describe how the cloud, the organisational transformation
and the CNCF landscape are accelerating the digitalisation of Deutsche Bahn.
