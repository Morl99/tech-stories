Unfortunately, persons responsible for organizational development and architects of software systems often work in separation – especially in large enterprises.
What are the negative effects of this separation and what can we do about it?
In this talk Dr. Martin Strunk presents “real world examples” of the impact that arising from the ignorance of Conway`s law by decision makers.
He will also propose ways, in which companies might overcome and mitigate these problems.

* Teams as first-class citizens
* Design comes first, then comes the participation
* Don’t rely on emergence to solve structural problems
