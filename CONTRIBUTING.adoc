== Releasing

Content is being drafted and reviewed in the DB-internal Git instance while deployment takes place via its GitHub representation and GitHub pages.

In order to keep things clean, we only push the `main` branch to GitHub:

[source,bash]
----
git remote add github git@github.com:dbsystel/tech-stories.git <1>

git checkout main
git pull origin main
git push github main
----
<1> You only have to do this once
